# AreaCalculator Library

## Main features

AreaCalculator is a biotech designed for installation in external classrooms, which allows you to calculate various geometric shapes, including a circle and a triangle. For the first time, free validation libraries were used to create a validation government for external data.h

#### Key functions:

- **Calculating the area of a circle based on a given radius**
- **Calculation of the area of a triangle on the specified three sides**
- **Checking the created triangle to see if it is rectangular**

#### General example of using the library:
~~~
using AreaCalculator;

public void Foo()
{
IShape shape;

        if (condition)
        {
figure = new circle(10);
        }
more
        {
figure = new triangle(10, 10, 10);
        }
        
        variable area = shape.Calculate the area();
    }

public void Boo()
{
var triangle = new triangle(3, 4, 5);
        
        // true
        var isRight = triangle.isRight;
    }
